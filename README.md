# GAS-Allocation-System-VHDL

This work demonstrates the possibilities of using modern FPGA CAD when designing digital control and diagnostics systems in electric power and gas supply.
The analysis of the schematic realization (synthesis) of the HDL models of the control device (control automaton - CA) and the hardware of the diagnostics (diagnostic machine - the diagnostic device - DD) allows to estimate the value of additional equipment costs by using the Quay criterion.
The analysis of additional expenses of the equipment showed that they can be compared with the hardware costs of the control device itself. 
On the one hand, this increases the hardware costs of the digital control system as a whole, but, on the other hand, when implementing the control system on the FPGA, the crystal, as a rule, is present unprogrammed programmable logic that can be used under the diagnostic hardware.
If to say about reduction of additional expenses of equipment on the device of diagnostics, then in the automated design of digital control systems should be used methods of standard design and built-in diagnostics.
